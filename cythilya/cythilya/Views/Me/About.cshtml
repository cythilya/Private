        <h3 class="heading">Education</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I graduated from Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering of National Taiwan Normal University with a master degree and Department of Computer and Information Science of Soochow University with a bachelor degree. My research field was artificial intelligence. I was trained to logically solving, organizing and analyzing problems after professional courses such as advanced algorithms and bioinformatics classes. I played a role as a leader or coordinator in every team reports. I planned the reports, track the progress, and communicate with members. I attach great importance to time management, effectiveness, hitting the exact center of the target, and helping others to get work done on time. Also, I care about group benefit. When members have quarrels, I always use my wisdom to solve the problems and not to be controlled by my mood. Most important of all, I always respect the leadership and communicate with the people directly rather than by the third one.

        @*學校之外－多方學習、提高視野*@
        <p class="paragraph">
            I joined different extracurricular activities aggressively. I learned painting from my childhood. I joined guitar club and marching band when I was a high school student. I was a secretary of the Student Congress and a volunteer of the health center in my college life. In my graduate life, I learned graphic design in Soochow’s Extension School and industrial design in Revival Design Academy. In addition, I learned zen meditation to examine myself. These great experiences make me more thorough, more responsible, and observe things from different aspects. Today, when facing to marcom or marketing partners, I can join earlier to give advice; when facing to designers, I can implement beautiful UI rapidly; when facing to back-end developers, I can work in perfect harmony because I learned back-end techniques at school.

        <p class="paragraph">
            <p>
                After graduating from NTNU, I was offered a job as a front end developer in Trend Micro, and it was a rewarding experience. I was requested to deliver prototypes which are early samples to test a concept or to conduct a usability test.
            </p>
            <p>
                During these five months, my coding ability improved a great deal. Also, I learned the skills of time-management and art of communication a lot. I worked in a multi-culture environment. When having culture shocks, smile is the best policy. I searched the answers with positive and optimistic attitude. In the meantime, I attended some English classes to improve my language skill. I realized that to be an outstanding engineer, except professional abilities, it is important to increase soft power.
